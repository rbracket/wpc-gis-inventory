# WPC GIS Curb Ramp Inventory App, version 0.2.2

In progress. Mobile web app for doing corner/curb ramp inventories in the field, can be modified for other purposes. Uses data stored in CartoDB. Originally built with OpenLayers & jQuery but now uses Leaflet for better speed and compatibility with multiple devices.

Uses/includes Leaflet Vectors plugin (https://github.com/JasonSanford/leaflet-vector-layers) for dynamic data viz, CartoDB Leaflet plugin (https://github.com/Vizzuality/cartodb-leaflet/) for easy jQuery popup access, and Bing Tile plugin from https://github.com/shramov/leaflet-plugins .
